Died: July 12, 1804
Alexander Hamilton feared that the "violence and turbulence of the democratic spirit" would undermine the newly independent United States. He worked for the establishment of a strong central government. He was among the most influential of the Founding Fathers.

Born on Nevis, in the Caribbean, Hamilton came to New York as a student in 1772. He became involved in the independence movement, writing pamphlets in support of the patriot cause. During the American Revolution, he was George Washington's most trusted aide. Later he was a delegate to the Constitutional Convention. There he urged that powers be shifted from the states to the federal government. He was also one of the authors of The Federalist. This influential series of essays supported ratification of the Constitution. As Washington's secretary of the treasury, Hamilton put the nation on a firm financial footing. He persuaded Congress to pay the debts of the individual states, and he instituted a stable currency. He created a national bank. And by imposing a tax on whiskey, he confirmed the government's right to levy taxes.

In 1804, Hamilton was killed by his political rival, Aaron Burr, in the most famous duel in American history.
